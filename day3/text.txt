1> call apply and bind??

answer==>
call apply and bind are normal javascript function which is helpful in borrowing the predefined function in a object.
example:
let name = {
    f_name: "Priya",
    l_name: "kesarwani"
}

let printFullName = function(hometown,state){
    console.log(this.f_name+" "+this.l_name);
}

let name2 = {
     f_name: "Sonali",
    l_name: "kesarwani"
}

printFullName.call(name2,"Pratapgarh","UP");
printFullName.apply(name2,["Pratapgarh","UP"]);
printMyName = printFullName.bind(name2,"Pratapgarh","UP");
printMyName();

In call method we pass the arguments individually but in apply method we pass arguments in array.
In bind method, instead of directly calling the method, it returns the copy of the menthod.

browser.js is mainly used for client side application  while in case of nodejs javascript code gets executed outside
the browser as it is an interpreter as well as environment for running js and used for server side application.

    }
}

reverse("priya");
